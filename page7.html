            <p>The time when people said, ok no, we making new art now</p>
            <p>"Both Araki and El Greco use figures that arenâ€™t completely anatomically correct and are actually
                elongated and in dramatic, exaggerated poses to make them aesthetically pleasant rather than accurate
                and realistic, have interesting and experimental color palettes (they both seem to give color priority
                over form for the sake of harmony in their art) and dynamic, extreme perspective and interweaving of the
                figure and the background which almost makes them undistinguishable due to the density of the designs"
            </p>

            <p>the similarity really shows in comparison, see: here and here</p>

            <p>i think this makes a lot of sense, seeing as how araki draws lots of inspiration from various
                renaissance artists! in this progress video he even flips through a photo book of some of michelangelo's
                sculptures as he draws. he's got like, shelves and shelves of reference material*. i always thought it
                was super interesting how araki is basically an inspiration sponge, soaking in all his favorite artists,
                musicians, models, and brands, and then incorporating them into his work. i guess its just neat that he
                really puts what he loves into what he does! i dunno, anyone else think so? i thought i might as well
